# Achieving sustainability: Unravelling the role of financial development and foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa

## Summary
As the global community grapples with sustainable development, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces a critical dilemma in balancing economic growth and environmental preservation. This study examines the effect of financial development (Foreign Direct Investment) on CO2 emissions in achieving sustainability in SSA. Employing FMOLS and DOLS cointegration approaches, the study demonstrates substantial connections between key variables. Environmental taxes and FDI negatively impact emissions, while industrial activities can decrease carbon emissions. 

The study explores causation between variables using Dumitrescu-Hurling panel causality tests. A bidirectional causality exists between the ecological footprint and CO2 emissions, while a unidirectional causality exists between the other variables and CO2 emissions. These findings have significant policy implications, suggesting enhanced environmental taxation policies and the encouragement of sustainable FDI. The introduction of green fiscal policies to stimulate renewable energy investments, promote responsible consumption, and trade practices to endorse cleaner production processes in SSA is recommended.

## Problem Statement
The unprecedented threat that climate change poses to human life and the environment necessitates responsible resource extraction, energy efficiency, and CO2 emission control worldwide. However, reducing CO2 emissions requires massive investment globally. SSA is seriously threatened by global warming despite having low CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, due to population and economic growth, the World Bank anticipates a positive upsurge in CO2 emissions. This continues to be a global threat to environmental decarbonization efforts. However, SSA holds potential for green financial development and decarbonization.

## Aim
This study aims to provide unique insights into sustainable financial developments and tax policies for funding environmentally friendly projects in SSA. It will also assist policymakers and stakeholders of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) in developing practical and sustainable measures to ensure free trade across Africa. Additionally, the study seeks to help policymakers create an environmental quality plan that can aid SSA countries in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 13. Furthermore, it explores how environmental taxes, ecological footprint, and natural resource rent impact CO2 emissions to achieve sustainability.

## Methodology
Yearly data from 1995-2019 covering ten (10) countries in SSA were used. The study utilized nine (9) variables obtained from the World Bank Indicators (WDI), OECD, Our World in Data, and Global Footprint Network. The Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) methods were employed to provide a robust analysis and conclusions. These methods handle unnoticed heterogeneity between regression numbers and serial correlations in error terms. The DOLS method incorporates lags and explanatory variables to handle endogeneity problems effectively and can evaluate cross-sectional dependence by accumulating parameters specific to a country, making it effective with small samples. To estimate panel causality, the study employed paired Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality tests.

## Modelling
Using an endogenous model with CO2 emissions, environmental tax, foreign direct investment, natural resource rent, total patent, trade openness, ecological footprint, consumption, and industry, the equation is as follows:

\[ 〖LCO2〗_it =  a_0+ β_1 LET_it+〖β_2 LFDI〗_it + β_3 LNRR_it  + 〖β_4 LTP〗_it+ β_5 LTOP_it + β_6 LEF_it+β_7 LC_it  +β_8 LI_it +  u_it …….. (1) ]

Where:
- **LCO2** = Log of carbon dioxide emissions
- **LET** = Log of environmental tax
- **LFDI** = Log of foreign direct investment
- **LNRR** = Log of natural resource rent
- **LTP** = Log of total patent
- **LTOP** = Log of trade openness
- **LEF** = Log of ecological footprint
- **LC** = Log of consumption
- **LI** = Log of industry

The period is represented by **t**, countries by **i**, **\alpha** is the intercept, **\beta_1** to **\beta_8** are parameter projections, and **\mu** is the error term.

### Logarithmic Model Transformation
Given the long-term relationship between factors, the equations above are converted to a logarithmic form:

\[Loge (CO2) = α + ∑ αloge (ET, FDI, NRR, TP, TOP, EF, C, I) ……. (2)]

The functional model is expressed as:

\[ 〖lnCO2〗_it =  a_0+ β_1 lnET_it+〖β_2 lnFDI〗_it + β_3 lnNRR_it  + 〖β_4 lnTP〗_it+ β_5 lnTOP_it + β_6 lnEF_it+β_7 lnC_it  +β_8 lnI_it +  u_it ……… (3)]

## Analytical Framework
The study’s analytical framework provides a structured methodology to examine financial development, foreign direct investment, and their impact on carbon emissions in SSA. The model accounts for causality relationships and key economic and environmental indicators, ensuring a comprehensive analysis.

## Recommendations
The findings offer useful insights for the global fight against climate change, particularly for academics, policymakers, and stakeholders in SSA. The study suggests implementing environmental policies, including environmental taxes, to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable development. 

### Policy Recommendations:
1. **Environmental Taxation**: Revenue from environmental taxes should be allocated to renewable energy projects.
2. **Encouraging Sustainable FDI**: Strengthen incentives for green investments and sustainable industrial growth.
3. **Establishment of Green Investment Areas**: Foster economic zones dedicated to renewable energy and sustainable development.
4. **Sustainable Resource Management**: Promote efficient resource utilization to mitigate environmental impacts.
5. **Trade Openness & Circular Economy Policies**: Enhance trade policies to align with sustainability goals.
6. **Support for Industrial Activities**: Promote eco-friendly industrial expansion with minimized carbon footprints.
7. **Sustainable Land Management**: Encourage policies that protect natural resources while fostering economic development.

By adopting these measures, SSA can enhance environmental sustainability while ensuring economic growth.
